<p> On July 29, 1958 the United States of America President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/dwight-d-eisenhower/">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act (NASA) into law. 
<strong>NASA</strong> was founded as a response to the Soviet Union's successful launch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik.</a> Its establishment involved significant contributions from various government officials and scientists, notably President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The idea for NASA emerged during the Cold War, particularly in response to the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the U.S. government sought to develop its own capabilities in space exploration, leading to the formation of NASA to centralize and coordinate Americian aerospace research and development.</p>
<p>NASA is primarily funded through annual appropriations from the U.S. federal government. For fiscal year 2024, NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-fiscal-year-2024-budget-request/"> budget</a> request was approximately $24 billion. Over the decades, NASA has received hundreds of billions in funding since its inception.
