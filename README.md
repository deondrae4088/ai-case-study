<p> On July 29, 1958 the United States of America President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/dwight-d-eisenhower/">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act (NASA) into law. 
<strong>NASA</strong> was founded as a response to the Soviet Union's successful launch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik.</a> Its establishment involved significant contributions from various government officials and scientists, notably President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The idea for NASA emerged during the Cold War, particularly in response to the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the U.S. government sought to develop its own capabilities in space exploration, leading to the formation of NASA to centralize and coordinate Americian aerospace research and development.</p>
<p>NASA is primarily funded through annual appropriations from the U.S. federal government. For fiscal year 2024, NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-fiscal-year-2024-budget-request/"> budget</a> request was approximately $24 billion. Over the decades, NASA has received hundreds of billions in funding since its inception. Key focuses include continued funding for the Artemis program aimed at lunar exploration, Mars Sample Return missions, and increasing investments in space technology. Major allocations include $8.3 billion for science programs and $7.97 billion for exploration, with significant attention to planetary science and the Mars Sample Return project.

<p>NASA aims to expand human knowledge about space, Earth, and the solar system while developing technology for future exploration missions. Key problems include climate change monitoring, planetary exploration, human safety in space, and technological advancements for scientific research. NASA is currently working on several high priority projects aimed at solving key scientific and exploratory challenges. Some of the major initiatives includes:

Challenges are developing new technologies for lunar surface habitats, spacecraft like the Orion capsule, and the Space launch System (SLS), as well as the Human Landing System (HLS)
