<h1 align="center">NASA </h1>
<p> On July 29, 1958 the United States of America President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/dwight-d-eisenhower/">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act (NASA) into law. 
<strong>NASA</strong> was founded as a response to the Soviet Union's successful launch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik.</a> Its establishment involved significant contributions from various government officials and scientists, notably President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The idea for NASA emerged during the Cold War, particularly in response to the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the U.S. government sought to develop its own capabilities in space exploration, leading to the formation of NASA to centralize and coordinate Americian aerospace research and development.</p>
<p>NASA is primarily funded through annual appropriations from the U.S. federal government. For fiscal year 2024, NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-fiscal-year-2024-budget-request/"> budget</a> request was approximately $24 billion. Over the decades, NASA has received hundreds of billions in funding since its inception. Key focuses include continued funding for the Artemis program aimed at lunar exploration, Mars Sample Return missions, and increasing investments in space technology. Major allocations include $8.3 billion for science programs and $7.97 billion for exploration, with significant attention to planetary science and the Mars Sample Return project.

<p>NASA aims to expand human knowledge about space, Earth, and the solar system while developing technology for future exploration missions. Key problems include climate change monitoring, planetary exploration, human safety in space, and technological advancements for scientific research. NASA is currently working on several high priority projects aimed at solving key scientific and exploratory challenges. Some of the major initiatives includes:

<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/ai-open-science-climate-change/"><strong><p>A.I. for Earth: How NASA’s Artificial Intelligence and Open Science Efforts Combat Climate Change</p></strong></a>
As severe weather events become more frequent worldwide due to climate change, there is an increasing necessity for research focused on our planet's rising temperatures. NASA addresses this need by not only studying these events but also supporting external researchers in their efforts. The agency's initiatives in artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a valuable means to achieve these objectives.

In 2023, NASA partnered with IBM Research to develop an AI geospatial foundation model. This model, built on extensive data from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), underpins a range of AI-driven studies aimed at addressing environmental issues. Consistent with open science practices, this model is available for free to all interested users.

Foundation models act as a foundational resource that scientists can use to create various applications, allowing for innovative and effective solutions. Manil Maskey, the data science lead at NASA’s Office of the Chief Science Data Officer (OCSDO), described these models as versatile tools—much like a Swiss Army Knife—that can serve multiple purposes.

Once a foundation model is established, it can be refined with smaller datasets to focus on particular tasks. So far, the Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concept Team (IMPACT) and its partners have showcased the model's potential by adjusting it to identify burn scars, outline flooded areas, and classify different types of land use, including crops. 
<strong><p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-enabled-ai-predictions-may-give-time-to-prepare-for-solar-storms/">NASA-enabled AI Predictions May Give Time to Prepare for Solar Storms</a></p></strong>
Similar to how tornado sirens alert communities in America's heartland to hazardous storms, a new computer model that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and NASA satellite data has the potential to warn us about dangerous space weather.

This model employs AI to examine measurements from spacecraft that capture the solar wind, which is a continuous flow of material emitted by the Sun. It can forecast where a solar storm might hit on Earth, giving a warning about 30 minutes in advance. This warning time could be crucial for making preparations to mitigate the significant effects these storms can have on power grids and vital infrastructure.  For a powerful solar storm in 1989 resulted in electrical outages in Quebec that lasted for 12 hours, leaving millions of Canadians without power and forcing schools and businesses to close. The most severe solar storm on record, known as the Carrington Event of 1859, ignited fires at telegraph stations and disrupted communication. If a similar event were to occur today, it would likely lead to even greater consequences, such as widespread electrical failures, prolonged blackouts, and interruptions in global communication systems. This kind of technological disruption could severely impact economies and pose risks to the safety and well-being of people around the globe.

Moreover, the threat of geomagnetic storms and their potential effects on society is increasing as we near the next solar maximum, which is expected around 2025, marking a peak in the Sun’s 11-year activity cycle.

To aid in preparation, a global team of researchers at the Frontier Development Lab—an initiative that brings together NASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Department of Energy—has been using artificial intelligence (AI) to explore links between solar wind and geomagnetic disruptions that can harm technology. They employed a deep learning approach, which trains computers to recognize patterns based on previous data. This AI technique helped them find correlations between solar wind data collected from heliophysics missions (including ACE, Wind, IMP-8, and Geotail) and geomagnetic disturbances recorded by ground stations worldwide.
As a result, they created a computer model named DAGGER (Deep Learning Geomagnetic Perturbation) that can swiftly and accurately forecast geomagnetic disturbances with a lead time of 30 minutes. The model can generate predictions in under a second and refreshes its forecasts every minute.

NASA’s spacecraft usually use radio systems controlled by humans to communicate with Earth. However, with the increasing amount of space data, NASA is turning to cognitive radio, which integrates artificial intelligence into space communication networks to handle the growing demand and improve efficiency.

 

“Modern space communication systems use advanced software to support scientific and exploration missions,” explained Janette C. Briones, the lead researcher on the cognitive communication project at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. “By incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning, satellites can manage these systems independently, making real-time decisions without waiting for instructions.”

 

To grasp the concept of cognitive radio, it’s helpful to start with its applications on Earth. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) assigns different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum for various communication purposes, such as cell service, satellite radio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. Think of the spectrum as a limited number of taps connected to a water main.<p>While private companies rapidly accelerate the commercialization of space, NASA's comprehensive scientific and exploratory missions set it apart in its accomplishments.  I would suggest that NASA focus on developing educational programs and public engagement initiatives that involve citizen science projects, such as community monitoring of climate changes or opportunities for the public to collaborate with scientists.  Engaging the public fosters greater interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, increases public support for funding, and enhances the community's understanding of NASA's missions. It can also generate valuable data for NASA's research objectives.</p>
